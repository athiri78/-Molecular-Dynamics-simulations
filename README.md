Tutorial of DM by LAMMPS
# LAMMPS tutorials for Beginners

These tutorials were recreated from my original tutorials at faculty of science Dhar el Mehraz LM2A, Uiversity Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Fez   (FSDM USMBA)  website with updates to codes within Jupyter Notebooks.  I hope this helps with everyone's learning curves for LAMMPS!  Thanks.

* [Click here to open Tutorial 1](LAMMPS-Tutorials-minimization.ipynb). Run LAMMPS! Learn how to calculate the minimum energy lattice structure
* [Click here to open Tutorial 2](LAMMPS-Tutorials-nve.ipynb). Run LAMMPS! Learn how to feed variables through the command line and mine log file for values to plot  or Python
* [Click here to open Tutorial 3](LAMMPS-Tutorials-nvt.ipynb). Run LAMMPS! Learn how to calculated cohesion energy and lattice parametre 
I've even tried to update the scripts here to some of the newer LAMMPS versions.  So far so good!
Beginner to Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, too?
